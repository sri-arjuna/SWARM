Allthough your scripts use SWARM, your scripts do not have to be GPLv2.


Terms for Company use:
----------------------

This said, you can use this framework for projects within your company.
While doing so, you are not allowed to alter the code of SWARM unless you fix bugs and send a pull request.

In fact, the only term I have if you want to use SWARM within a/your company is exactly this,
that at least one person occasionaly spends 1-2 hours looking at the known issues and send possible bug fixes.
Of course, if they stumble upon something they could improve in regards of performance, stability or security,
that is very welcome too!


Statement:
----------
However, to 'repeat' the GPLv2 - I deny any responsiblity,
for any possible damange, like - but not limited to - data loss,
unusable system, growing grey hairs, or any variation that may occour.

Using FOSS is risky if you are not willing to invest something back into it.
See the Heartbleed incident, 1 person can not possible cover every security issue there is.
And this is the precice reason why 'a company' must spend some resources to help fixing bugs
and security issues in and for SWARM - if they want to use it.

Keep in mind, from 0 to SWARM, I have invested about 5 years,
where I spent almost every day 6-18 hours working on 'this'.
(5 * 365 - 30 ('offdays')) * ~12 == 21'540 hours
So I would say, 'giving a few hours back' is a fair trade.
