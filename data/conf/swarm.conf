#	SWARM - Configuration file - Default root settings
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	This file is part of the 'SWARM' package
#	and is not ment to be changed.
#
#	After changing It is highly recomended to create and change
#	custom configuration using 'SWARM'.
#
#	System administrators may change system wide settings here.
#	You'll find the user.conf template in $TUI_DIR_SYSTEM/conf.home
#	to prepare user configuration files, which should at least have
#	a different theme than this file.
#
#
#	'Core' settings  :	Booleans
#
	# By default, this will log to: ''~/.config/swarm/swarm.log' or
	# '/var/tmp/swarm.log' in root or fallback mode
	doLog=true
	# The following will also log every success, this should only be used for debug purposes!
	doLogExt=${doLogExt:-false}
	# This is merly a plaything
	doSlowLoading=${doSlowLoading:-false}
	# While implementing, this overwrites 'echo' and 'mkdir'
	# with internal compatibility functions of SWARM.
	# By default, $ECHO and $MKDIR are assigned to those functions already
	# for the very same reasons.
	doAlias=false
#
#	'Core' settings : Values
#
	# Set the intervall for LINES and WIDTH updates
	# Set to 0 to disable ; Attention, low values like 1 might cause performance issues
	SWARM_INTERVALL_GEOMETRY=${SWARM_INTERVALL_GEOMETRY:-30}
	# Set the slow loading intervall to anything between 0.1 - 1
	SWARM_INTERVALL_SLOW_LOADING=${SWARM_INTERVALL_SLOW_LOADING:-0.3}
	SWARM_SKIP_THEME_WIDTH=${SWARM_SKIP_THEME_WIDTH:-25}
