You can still customize SWARM without breaking the GPLv2 license!

Just as a reminder, SWARM is a framework to build/write your scripts upon,
so writing a script project while using SWARM and distribunting them together for free is allowed.

First and foremost, keep in mind that if you use SWARM, you probably will use 'swarm' for your project.
The function 'swarm' does provide a way to add your own libraries to your project collected in your projects root directory.
This is the recomended method for fine-tuning.

If you should have a very special approach, you can write your own scripts using the internal function names and save them under:
$SWARM_USER_DIR_{CONF,LIBS} (default: ~/.config/swarm/{conf,libs}

This way, you do not touch the original source code, but still change/overwrite existing code.
If you do this to bugfix, please send me a pull request on github!
