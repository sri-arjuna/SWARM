.SH NAME
\fBpick\fP - select, swarm-Style
\fB
.SH SYNOPSYS
pick [ -1 -2 -a -m ] $LIST or "${ARRAY[@]}"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an emulator of the \fBselect\fP program. This emulator is required to keep the themed-feeling intact.
Unlike \fBselect\fP you cannot write menu inside the select block, because \fBpick\fP will just return the string of the selected item.
You can however pass \fB-m\fP to start it in \fImenu\fP-mode.

.SH OPTIONS
  -1|-2	Print that many rows
  -a		Auto select if only one entry was found
  -m		Prints '\fBBack\fP' (translated) as option \fB0\fP in the selection.
  		If '\fBBack\fP' is selected, return code is 4, 0 otherwise.
  -q		This does not print the selected item to \fBstdout\fP. This should be used if you use \fB$PICKED\fP rather than \fB$var\fP.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
REPLY
Contains the number of the item that was last selected.
.TP
PICKED
Contains the full string of the last selected item.

.SH EXAMPLE
pick $LIST
.RE
var=$(pick -a $LIST)
.RE
var=$(pick -2 -m "${ARRAY[@]}") ; $ECHO "$REPLY / $PICKED / $var"
